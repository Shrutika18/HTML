    <h1>User and Workspace Settings</h1>
    <p>It is easy to configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.</p>
    <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/settings/hero.png" alt="">
    <p>VS Code provides two different scopes for settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Settings</strong> - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.</li>
        <li><b>Workspace Settings</b> - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Workspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong>A VS Code "workspace" is usually just your project root folder. Workspace settings as well as
        <a href="lists.html">debugging</a>and <a href="#">task</a> configurations are stored at the root in a .vscode folder. You can also have more than one root folder in a VS Code workspace through a feature called Multi-root workspaces. You can learn more in the What is a VS Code "workspace"? article.
